# Forking Paths  
*A Modular Synthesizer with Patch Histories*

Forking Paths is a modular synthesizer that records and plays back your patch changes like a musical timeline. Every cable connection, knob turn, and gesture is saved — so you can recall past states, remix changes, or create sequences from your history.

ELI5: Think of it as getting *really* creative with the undo/redo history of a software synthesizer. 

## Quick Start

1. Click **Join** on a room in the Lobby (left column). The **Synth App** will open. 
2. In the Synth App, choose **File > Load Demo Synth**.
3. Start patching. After the first patch edit, you’ll see the **Patch History** window open automatically.
4. Click any **Help** button (`?`) to learn how to use the unique controls of teh **Patch History** window:
   - Patch History Graph
   - Query Tool
   - History Sequencer
   - Gesture Editor
