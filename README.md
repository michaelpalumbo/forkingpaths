# Forking Paths

## Synth 

**Add Module:**  
Double-click anywhere in the grey background.

**Modify Module Layout:**  
Hold down the `e` key and drag any module element (e.g., input, slider, etc.) to reposition it.  
*Coming soon: changing the module layout will save in the user's settings.*

**Drag multiple modules:**  
Cmd/Ctrl + click + drag to select multiple elements, then drag any module to move them all at once.

**Make cable connections**
Inputs are orange triangles, outputs are blue squares. Click and drag from either of these elements to spawn a cable. Release the click when hovering over an input or output. Note that inputs can only be connected out outputs and vice versa. 

## History Graph

**Scroll:**  
Cmd/Ctrl + scroll.

**Zoom:**  
Press `z` + scroll

**Recall Synth State**
Click any node to recall that point in the history. If you make any changes to the synth while in this earlier state, the history will spawn a new history path.

## History Sequencing

**Add node as a step**
Hold *shift* then *click* one or more nodes. You can add the same node multiple times and at different points in the sequence. 

**Pause sequencer (momentary)**
Hold *shift*. release to resume sequence. 

**Remove node step**
Hold *shift* and then *right-click* a node. Note that this only removes the last-added instance of this node. Keep right-clicking to remove all instances of this node in the sequence.
