### History Query Tool

This tool lets you search the entire patch history for meaningful changes — like isolating all gestures, connections, or everything connected to a specific module.

---

### Interface Overview

The query tool is a simple dropdown menu.

- Select one or more change types — like `parameter change`, `gesture`, `cable connect`, or `merge`
- A list of matching nodes will appear in the panel below
- Click any result to instantly load that patch state into the synth
- If the change includes a gesture, it will also load into the gesture editor

The graph view stays visible while using the tool, so you can stay oriented as you explore.

### Actions

You can:
- 🧭 Filter the history graph by change type  
- 🖱 Click a result to preview that patch state and gesture  
- 🖱 Click a result and then ⌘+Click (Mac) or Ctrl+Click (PC) on a sequencer row to assign it directly to a sequencer step  

This with building a custom sequence from the most interesting or expressive points in your patch history.

### Coming Soon

The following features are planned for future updates:

- ✅ **Multi-select filters**: e.g., show only cable disconnections from a specific module  
- ✅ **Logical filters**: choose `AND` or `OR` to control how filter conditions are combined  
- ✅ **Batch sequencer assignment**: assign multiple query results to different steps at once  
- ✅ **Time filters**: show only recent edits or changes made in a specific session  
- ✅ **Author filters**: isolate changes made by a specific peer in collaborative settings  
- ✅ **Graph highlighting**: visually spotlight all results directly in the history graph 
- ✅ **Peer Changes**: Get changes specific to a peer (multiplayer mode)

### Use Cases

The query tool is useful for:

- 🎛 **Exploration**: quickly surface gestures or major structural changes  
- ✏️ **Editing**: return to and modify any specific point in your patch history  
- ⏺ **Sequencing**: assign key moments to steps in your patch sequencer  
- 👥 **Collaboration**: see who did what, and when (peer-based filtering support in progress)
