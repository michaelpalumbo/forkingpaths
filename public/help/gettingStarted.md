# Forking Paths  
*A Modular Synthesizer with Patch Histories*

Forking Paths is a modular synthesizer that records and plays back your patch changes like a musical timeline. Every cable connection, knob turn, and gesture is saved â€” so you can recall past states, remix changes, or create sequences from your history.

ELI5: Think of it as getting *really* creative with the undo/redo history of a software synthesizer. 

## Quick Start

1. This app must be **run in Chrome**. (Other chromium browsers like Brave aren't supported) 

2. This app operates across several tabs. Some will open automatically.

3. The first tab that will open has a **HELP button in the top-right corner.** Use that to get started making sounds!

4. **Join** a room in the Forking Paths Lobby (left column of this page). The **Synth App** will open.
