# Getting Started with Forking Paths Synth
----------------------------------------

To begin using the synth:

1.  Go to **File > Load Demo Synth**\
    This will load a prebuilt patch and automatically open the **Patch History** window in a new tab or window.

2.  **Keep the Patch History window open.**\
    You'll use it for sequencing, editing gestures, and navigating your patch history. If you accidentally close it, reopen it via **View > Open Patch History**.

3.  For the best experience, try one of the following:

    -   **Resize this window and the Patch History window** so they sit side-by-side.

    -   Or use keyboard shortcuts to switch quickly between them:\
        `Cmd + \`` (Mac) or` Alt + Tab` (PC)

## Workspace & Collaboration Panel
-------

On the right side of the screen, you'll find the **Workspace & Collaboration Panel**. It includes:

-   **Local tools** for managing your own patches and preferences (under the **My Workspace** section)

-   **Collaborative tools** for connecting and interacting with other players

-------

### 🔧 My Workspace (Local Tools)

The **My Workspace** section includes menus like **File**, **View**, **System**, and **Testing**.\
➡️ *These actions affect only your own session* --- they won't impact your peers unless you explicitly share changes.

#### 📁 File

-   **Load Demo Synth**: Load a prebuilt patch with connected history.

-   **Load Synth from Disk**: Import a saved `.fpsynth` file.

-   **Save Patch History**: Save your current patch and state.

#### 👁️ View

-   **Open Patch History**: Launch the patch timeline interface.

-   **Open Synth Designer**: Design new synth layouts from scratch.

#### ⚙️ System

-   **Settings**: Change volume, cable spacing, and toggle RMS analysis (⚠️ CPU-heavy).

-   **Resume Audio**: Reactivate the audio engine if it's paused.

### 🎚 Audio Engine Tips

-   If the **System** menu blinks red, audio is paused.

-   Click **Resume Audio** to enable DSP.

    -   `Pause Audio`: DSP is running

    -   `Resume Audio` (blinking red): DSP is off

-   If you're not hearing anything, this is the first thing to try --- browsers often block audio until you interact with the page.
