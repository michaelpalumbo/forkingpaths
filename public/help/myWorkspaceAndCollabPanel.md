# Getting Started with Forking Paths Synth

Help panels just like this one are available throughout the app. Just click the green *Help* button within a given section of the page. 

## Workspace & Collaboration Panel

On the right side of the screen, you'll find the **Workspace & Collaboration Panel**. It includes:

- A **menubar** for viewing other pages of the Forking Paths App, configuring settings, and providing feedback to Michael (the developer). 
- A **Synth Browser** for exploring and loading synthesizers from your computer or online
- Buttons for **Clearing, Saving, and Loading Patch Histories**
- **Collaborative tools** for connecting and interacting with other players


## Quick Start:

1.  Under the Workspace title, locate the **Open Synth Browser...** button, click it, and then click **Load Demo Synth**
    This will load a prebuilt patch and automatically open the **Patch History** window in a new tab or window.

2.  **Keep the Patch History window open.**\
    You'll use it for sequencing, editing gestures, and navigating your patch history. If you accidentally close it, reopen it via **View > Open Patch History**.

3.  For the best experience, use keyboard shortcuts to switch quickly between them:
        `Cmd + \`` (Mac) or` Alt + Tab` (PC)

4. To begin patching, you can close this Help window, and open the *Help* button at the top-left of the app to get started with sound!

## Workspace

The **Workspace** section includes menus like **View**, **System**, and **Testing**, along with buttons for working with patch histories and the draw tool. 

### View

- **Open Patch History**: Launch the patch timeline interface.
- **Open Synth Designer**: Design new synth layouts from scratch.

### System

- **Settings**: Change volume, cable spacing, and toggle RMS analysis (⚠️ CPU-heavy).
- **Resume Audio**: Reactivate the audio engine if it's paused.

### Audio Engine Tips

- If the **System** menu blinks red, audio is paused.
- Click **Resume Audio** to enable DSP.
- `Pause Audio`: DSP is running 
- `Resume Audio` (blinking red): DSP is off
-   If you're not hearing anything, this is the first thing to try --- browsers often block audio until you interact with the page.

### Playtesting
You can also access this in the "Give Feedback" menu.
Options:
- **Feedback Form**: [User Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/aerpRUgBR7bH1xpB9)
- **Report a Bug**: [Submit a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/forkingpaths/issues/new)

### Draw Tool

You can draw anywhere within the synth view. Click and drag to do this. If you open the history window you'll see that each pen stroke is saved in the version history. To erase your drawings, click "Erase Drawing"
