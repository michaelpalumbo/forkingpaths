# Getting Started with Forking Paths Synth

Help panels just like this one are available throughout the app. Just click the green *Help* button within a given section of the page. 

## Quick Start:

1.  Under the Workspace title, locate the **Open Synth Browser...** button, click it, and then click **Load Demo Synth**
    This will load a prebuilt patch and automatically open the **Patch History** window in a new tab or window.

2.  **Keep the Patch History window open.**\
    You'll use it for sequencing, editing gestures, and navigating your patch history. If you accidentally close it, reopen it by clicking the **Open Patch History**.

3.  For the best experience, use keyboard shortcuts to switch quickly between them:
        `Cmd + \`` (Mac) or` Alt + Tab` (PC)

4. Check that the app's audio is turned on. In the menubar is an item called **System**. If it is flashing red, that means that DSP is disabled. Click it and then click **Resume Audio** to enable it. 

5. To begin patching, you can close this Help window, and open the *Help* button at the top-left of the app to get started with sound!

## Workspace

The **Workspace** section includes the menus **System** and **Testing**, along with buttons for working with the draw tool. 

### System

- **Settings**: Change volume, cable spacing, and toggle RMS analysis (⚠️ CPU-heavy).
- **Resume Audio**: Reactivate the audio engine if it's paused.

### Audio Engine Tips

- If the **System** menu blinks red, audio is paused.
- Click **Resume Audio** to enable DSP.
- `Pause Audio`: DSP is running 
- `Resume Audio` (blinking red): DSP is off
-   If you're not hearing anything, this is the first thing to try --- browsers often block audio until you interact with the page.

### Playtesting
You can also access this in the "Give Feedback" menu.
Options:
- **Feedback Form**: [User Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/aerpRUgBR7bH1xpB9)
- **Report a Bug**: [Submit a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/michaelpalumbo/forkingpaths/issues/new)

### Draw Tool

You can draw anywhere within the synth view. Click and drag to do this. If you open the history window you'll see that each pen stroke is saved in the version history. To erase your drawings, click "Erase Drawing"
