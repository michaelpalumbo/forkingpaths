query tool: make it so users can select multiple options (i.e. selected module changes & cable changes = only the cable changes of that selected module)

query tool: have another dropdown next to it for logic: ( &&, OR etc) i.e. && means all checked items have to be satisfied, OR means any items that are checked

query tool: multi-select and assign all results to the sequencer table

query tool: filtering by time range, recency, or collaborator (i.e. peer name) (IMPORTANT: is peer name even stored in any of the change data?)

query tool: highlight all results in the history graph


gesture editor: gestures can be trimmed, extended, or otherwise shaped before reassignment? E.g., clipping to first 2 seconds, or looping the first N values?


sequencer: when playing a gesture as a step, load that gesture into the editor

legibility: after saving a gesture, its node is highlighted. but if you click another node, the first node remains highlighted (should unhighlight)

**PRIORITY: history graph gesture node: when player clicks on a gesture node, that gesture should begin playing back in the editor just once.**
