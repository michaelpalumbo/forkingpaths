query tool: make it so users can select multiple options (i.e. selected module changes & cable changes = only the cable changes of that selected module)

query tool: have another dropdown next to it for logic: ( &&, OR etc) i.e. && means all checked items have to be satisfied, OR means any items that are checked

query tool: multi-select and assign all results to the sequencer table

query tool: filtering by time range, recency, or collaborator (i.e. peer name) (IMPORTANT: is peer name even stored in any of the change data?)

query tool: highlight all results in the history graph

gesture assign: instead of selecting default on load, it should select the current param that this gesture is associated with. this will make it a lot clearer

gesture assign: allow player to define how the assign is scaled (linear, log, maybe 2 or 3 kinds of curves)

gesture editor: gestures can be trimmed, extended, or otherwise shaped before reassignment? E.g., clipping to first 2 seconds, or looping the first N values?

gesture editor: when mapping continuous control onto a selectmenu, the gesture will not display correctly (we get NaN)
